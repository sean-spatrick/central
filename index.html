                    This project was done as part of SBU's Web Design and culture class. I will always love this project. I could not have asked for a more 
                    outstanding team. Together we explored the the intersection between online pop culture and the occasionally ludicrous world of Fine Art.
                    On this prject I served as head of UX and Development.

                    MESHD is one of the most incredible oportunities I've had at Stony Brook University. Born as WolfieSync in the fall of 2016 This project went through so many iterations and design changes until our ragtag group of art and computer science students finally arrived at a working beta released on February 17th. We will be partnering with <a href="http://www.cewit.org/">The Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology</a> and look forward to entering our platform in New York State Governor Cuomo's <a href="https://www.ny.gov/programs/tuition-free-degree-program-excelsior-scholarship#competition">coding challenge</a>. On this project I served as head of Brand Design, UX/UI development, and worked closely with the project leader to market our platform to the University and the State of New York as a whole.
